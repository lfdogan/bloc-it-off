# Bloc It Off

This project uses AngularJS and Firebase to create a to-do list where the tasks self-terminate if not completed within 7 days. The project was started by using files from the Bloc Frontend Project Starter repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Bloc/bloc-frontend-project-starter.git <your-frontend-project-name>
```
